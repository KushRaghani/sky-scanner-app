# Sky Scanner App - FrontEnd + BackEnd


The Sky Scanner App has been built using React.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The source code for this is in frontend and backend folders respectively which are present on the root of the repository. To run these projects, navigate to the respevtive folders and follow the README.md

For the build step on the UI, WebPack has been used with Babel. On the backend, Pure Node.js has been used without any frameworks since the usecase required something that was light weight. Jest framework has been used to write unit tests on both frontend and backend. For shallow/mounting Enzyme has been used on the UI alon with React Test Renderer for Snapshot testing.

To get data, RAPID API has been used.
